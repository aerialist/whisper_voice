Making Throat Mic Audio Sound Like a Normal Air Mic

Challenges of Throat Microphone Audio

A throat microphone (laryngophone) picks up vibrations directly from the neck, which yields very different audio characteristics compared to a normal air-conduction microphone. Throat mics strongly capture low-frequency voiced sounds from the vocal cords (vowels), but they miss most high-frequency components like consonants and fricatives produced by the mouth, tongue, and lips . As a result, raw throat-mic speech sounds muffled and largely unintelligible on its own – “all vowels” with nearly no “s,” “f,” “sh” sounds, etc. This bandwidth limitation and altered spectral profile means that without processing, throat mic audio will sound unnatural and perform poorly with standard speech recognition models (which are trained on normal mic audio). The goal, therefore, is to restore or reconstruct the missing high-frequency information and natural timbre so that throat-mic speech resembles normal speech.

Analog Circuit Approaches

Basic analog filters (EQ circuits) can partially shape a throat mic’s output to mimic a normal mic’s frequency response. For example, one could use high-pass or high-shelf filters to boost the treble frequencies and attenuate any low-frequency boom. In practice, however, a throat mic may simply not capture any useful signal above a few kHz, so there is a limit to what analog EQ can do . At best, analog equalization can improve clarity slightly by amplifying whatever faint high-frequency vibrations might be present . Some throat mic designs use two piezo elements (coupling on both sides of the neck) to broaden the pickup and maybe capture a bit more of the speech spectrum, but the fundamental limitation remains – you cannot magically obtain consonant sounds that were never transduced .

Other analog techniques could involve non-linear circuits or “exciters.” An analog harmonic generator can introduce new overtones (simulated high-frequency content) by distorting the signal. This is analogous to the aural exciter used in audio processing: by adding subtle distortion and filtering, one can create artificial high-frequency components to brighten the sound. In a simple form, a diode or FET-based circuit could full-wave rectify or clip the throat mic signal, generating harmonics, and then filter those as “faux fricatives.” While this can make the voice crisper, it’s essentially adding guessed noise and harmonics rather than true speech information. Such analog tricks were historically used in narrowband radio comms to improve intelligibility, but they yield only moderate gains.

Pros: Analog solutions are low-latency (essentially zero delay) and power-efficient. They can be implemented with simple op-amp circuits or passive components on a battery-powered device with negligible processing cost. A Cortex-M4 class microcontroller could even emulate these analog filters in code (using its DAC/ADC) with minimal CPU usage. This means real-time processing is trivial – under 1 ms latency – making analog or basic DSP attractive for simple, low-power wearables.

Cons: Analog filtering cannot recover truly missing information . If the throat mic signal contains almost no energy above, say, 4 kHz, boosting that band just raises noise. Thus, speech will remain muffled and certain phonetic details (sibilants, breathiness) won’t be restored. Analog approaches also lack adaptability – they can’t intelligently distinguish voiced vs. unvoiced sounds or adjust to different speakers. Overall, while basic EQ on a throat mic “helps a bit,” it won’t achieve normal mic quality on its own .

Traditional DSP Techniques (Non-ML)

Digital signal processing can take us further than analog by using more sophisticated filtering and modeling of speech. Key DSP approaches include:
	•	Multi-band EQ and Dynamic Filtering: Instead of a fixed filter, a DSP algorithm can apply frequency-specific gain dynamically. For instance, one can design an inverse filter to compensate the average throat-mic frequency response, effectively flattening the throat mic’s spectrum and then equalizing it to match a typical air-mic profile. In practice, you might measure a frequency response curve of throat vs. air mic on the same speech and design a digital FIR/IIR filter to approximate the difference. This will amplify mid/high frequencies that are attenuated in the throat mic. Some devices also use dynamic range compression/expansion in certain bands – e.g. if a fricative is detected to be present but weak, the algorithm could amplify high-frequency noise during those periods. However, reliably detecting those phonetic events from throat audio alone is challenging.
	•	Source-Filter Modeling: Human speech can be modeled as a source (glottal excitation from vocal cords) passed through a vocal tract filter (which shapes formants and consonant sounds). A throat mic largely captures the glottal source well (the buzzing of vocal folds) but misses the full effect of the vocal tract and mouth radiation. DSP methods can attempt to estimate the vocal tract filter that would have produced the observed throat signal, then replace or enhance it with a more typical filter. For example, linear predictive coding (LPC) analysis on throat audio could estimate resonances; one could then impose known formant patterns of normal speech. In essence, the algorithm tries to infer what the mouth is doing (formant frequencies) from the throat signal. Research has shown that voiced segments (vowels) can indeed be enhanced by such modeling, aligning their formant frequencies closer to normal speech  . However, unvoiced consonants (which have no glottal source) remain problematic – there may be little to no signal for the DSP to latch onto . Some approaches add a controlled noise to mimic unvoiced sounds: e.g. inject broadband noise shaped to the expected spectrum of an “s” or “sh” when the algorithm suspects a fricative (perhaps triggered by sudden absence of voicing energy). This can improve intelligibility, but it’s essentially guessing the consonant and can sound robotic or incorrect if mis-timed.
	•	Bandwidth Extension Techniques: The problem of throat mics is analogous in some ways to bandwidth extension of telephone speech. Telephone audio (narrowband 300–3400 Hz) lacks high frequencies; many DSP techniques were developed to regenerate high-band content from low-band features (codebook mapping, spectral folding, etc.). These can be applied to throat mic audio as well. Early methods (circa 1970s–2000s) used codebooks or statistical mapping to add high-frequency components. For example, if certain low-frequency spectral patterns are detected (indicating a phoneme), a stored high-frequency spectral shape can be appended. While these can add intelligibility by reintroducing hiss for sibilants and clarity for consonants, the quality is limited and may sound artificial  .

Effectiveness: Traditional DSP can significantly improve throat mic speech intelligibility. One study using an analytic mapping (symbolic regression) of throat to normal mic features showed word recognition accuracy jumping from 16.5% (raw throat mic) to 70.9% after enhancement   – a dramatic improvement. Users would understand much more of the conversation. However, the same study noted that even this fell short of the 88% accuracy obtained by simply retraining the speech recognizer on throat-mic data . In other words, classical DSP can bridge a lot of the gap, but not entirely; some information remains irrecoverable. The voiced parts (vowels) can be made to sound fairly normal, but unvoiced parts are “not good enough” with purely rule-based enhancement . Listeners might perceive an odd whispery noise in place of certain consonants, or a “band-limited” quality overall.

Real-time feasibility: These DSP algorithms can be implemented on Cortex-M4 class microcontrollers or small DSP chips. They typically operate on short frames (e.g. 10–20 ms of audio) and involve FFTs, filters, and simple arithmetic – tasks well within the reach of an M4 with a DSP instruction set. Memory requirements are modest (a few kilobytes for filters/buffers). Latency can be kept low (perhaps one frame of delay, ~10–20 ms, or even lower if streaming sample-by-sample). Power usage is minimal, which is ideal for battery-powered devices. Thus, an embedded throat-mic module could use traditional DSP to output an improved audio stream in real-time. This is a viable approach for small wearables – with the caveat that the improvement, while noticeable, still won’t fully match a true air microphone in quality.

Machine Learning Approaches (Classical)

Moving beyond hand-crafted DSP, machine learning (ML) can learn the mapping from throat mic audio to normal audio. Early attempts (mid-2000s) used techniques like neural networks and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to perform spectral mapping. The idea is to collect a parallel dataset: a person speaks with a throat mic and a regular mic simultaneously, then train a model to predict the normal mic’s features from the throat mic’s features.

One influential study (Shahina & Yegnanarayana, 2007) trained a feed-forward neural network to map throat-mic cepstral coefficients to close-talking mic cepstra . The network essentially learned the functional relationship between the two audio domains for a given speaker. The result was that the reconstructed speech sounded much more natural – the mapping produced a smooth spectral estimate of the normal speech and “no distortions are perceived in the reconstructed speech” . In other words, the neural network was able to add the missing frequency content in a way that blended well, avoiding the artifacts that simpler DSP tricks often introduce. This approach can be seen as a form of learned bandwidth extension, and indeed the authors noted it could even be applied to improve telephone-band speech using a similar technique.

Subsequent work has built on this: for example, using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) or shallow neural nets to do frame-by-frame spectral transformations. A more recent ML study used MFCC features from throat and air mics and trained a multi-layer feedforward network (MLFFNN) to map throat MFCCs to air-mic MFCCs . Their system specifically “corrected the missed and degraded frequencies of the TM (throat mic) speech,” producing an enhanced speech signal . Objective measures like PESQ (perceptual quality) and formant analysis showed that the enhanced speech’s formant frequencies align much closer to the target normal speech  . In plain terms, the machine-learned mapping can restore the vocal tract resonances and high-frequency cues more accurately than manual filtering. Subjectively, listeners would find the voice more intelligible and natural after ML-based enhancement.

Pros: Classical ML models (like small neural nets or GMMs) are lightweight compared to modern deep learning. They often have only a few thousand parameters and can run in real-time on a CPU (or even on a microcontroller, if carefully optimized). For instance, a 2-layer MLP evaluating a few dozen features per frame is on the order of tens of thousands of multiply-adds per frame – easily done in microseconds on a Cortex-M4 at 100 MHz. These models can also be quantized to 8-bit or 16-bit fixed-point for efficiency. So embedded deployment is feasible, though an M4 might be at its limits if the model is too large or if 44.1 kHz audio must be processed with very short frames. A more powerful Cortex-A (like a Raspberry Pi or smartphone CPU) can easily handle this in real-time with CPU cycles to spare. Latency can be kept low (one frame of delay ~10 ms), satisfying even strict <10 ms requirements in ideal cases.

Another advantage is that ML models can be made speaker-dependent or independent. A speaker-dependent model (trained on one user’s voice) can very accurately map their throat audio to their normal voice – great for personal devices. However, it means each user needs training data. Speaker-independent models trained on many people exist (e.g. using datasets like ATR503 or newly published corpora) which make the enhancement usable out-of-the-box for anyone, albeit possibly with slightly less precision than a personalized model.

Cons: The performance of classical ML is still bounded by the data and model capacity. Early neural nets improved quality a lot, but still couldn’t perfectly recover unvoiced sounds in all cases . If the throat mic has virtually zero signal for an “s” sound, the network might output a very faint approximation or sometimes nothing – it might err on the side of not hallucinating a loud “s” to avoid distortion. In practice, these systems greatly boost intelligibility but may still sound somewhat “processed.” Additionally, training such models requires a parallel dataset of throat vs. normal recordings, which can be labor-intensive to collect (though some datasets now exist).

On device, one must also store the model and possibly run feature extraction (MFCC or similar) each frame. Feature extraction (FFT, etc.) is usually the heavier part but still doable on embedded hardware with optimized libraries. A Cortex-A or PC can handle it in realtime easily. A Cortex-M4 might handle it with fixed-point libraries (e.g. CMSIS DSP for FFT/MFCC) but could be challenged at 44.1 kHz unless using small FFT sizes (many solutions downsample to 16 kHz, which eases computation and is often sufficient for speech). Power consumption for a small ML model on a microcontroller is still very low (tens of mW or less), so battery impact is minimal – it’s comparable to doing some audio decoding.

Advanced Deep Learning & Neural Vocoders

In recent years, deep learning has enabled even more powerful throat-mic enhancement, using techniques from speech synthesis and voice conversion. These approaches use large neural networks (often with millions of parameters) to learn complex transformations or generate audio. Key developments include:
	•	End-to-End Neural Networks: Instead of operating on hand-crafted features, deep models can take raw spectrograms or waveforms from the throat mic and output a reconstructed waveform of normal speech. Examples include convolutional or recurrent networks that perform speech-to-speech conversion. For instance, researchers have tried sequence-to-sequence models or U-Net style architectures that map a throat mic spectrogram to an air mic spectrogram. These can capture very nuanced nonlinear relationships and contextual information (e.g. using several frames of history to infer an upcoming consonant). Early attempts (2010s) using deep neural networks or deep autoencoders already showed improved quality over shallow models, but the real leap has been with modern architectures and data.
	•	Neural Vocoder Approach: A particularly powerful paradigm is to use the throat mic to extract some intermediate representation (like text, phonemes, or mel-spectrogram features) and then use a neural vocoder to synthesize a natural waveform. Neural vocoders (e.g. WaveNet, WaveRNN, LPCNet, MelGAN, HiFi-GAN) are models originally developed for text-to-speech that can generate very natural human voice given a conditioning input (usually a mel-spectrogram or similar). In a throat-mic context, one could first predict a “normal speech” mel-spectrogram from the throat mic audio (using a deep model), then feed that mel-spec into a neural vocoder to produce the final audio. The vocoder would effectively restore the missing high-frequency content and natural timbre, since it’s been trained on normal speech and knows how to produce those sounds. For example, one could train a vocoder conditioned on features derived from throat audio directly – essentially learning to synthesize clean speech from throat signals. Voice conversion research from 2009 onwards (Toda et al. 2009 , and many others since) has explored this: early works used Gaussian mixture models as vocoders, while modern ones use GANs or autoregressive models for higher quality.
	•	Latest Neural Codec/Vocoder Models: Very cutting-edge work (2023–2025) has started using neural audio codecs and diffusion models as a basis for throat mic enhancement. One example is a 2025 study that fine-tuned a neural audio codec called Mimi (a state-of-the-art streaming codec by Kyudai/Kyutai Labs) on a dataset of paired throat/air recordings (the Vibravox dataset). By doing so, they essentially taught the codec to “decode” a low-quality throat signal into a high-quality speech signal. This approach leveraged a pretrained audio model as a foundation, then specialized it for throat mics . The result outperformed prior state-of-the-art models in intelligibility and quality . Notably, this system runs in real-time and allows users to toggle the enhancement on/off while visualizing spectrograms , demonstrating that even complex deep models can be optimized for interactive speeds.

Another cutting-edge angle is using diffusion-based vocoders or speech enhancement models, which could progressively add back the missing high-frequency components as a “denoising” task, treating the throat mic audio like a degraded version of speech and “denoising” it into natural speech. These are still researchy but promising.

Quality: Deep learning methods, when properly trained, can produce remarkably natural-sounding results. They are capable of hallucinating the missing consonants in a plausible way. For instance, a deep model might deduce from context that a certain unvoiced interval is likely an “s” sound (perhaps by language modeling or sequence context) and inject an appropriate sibilant noise at the right moment – something a simpler system wouldn’t dare to do. As a result, enhanced audio can be nearly indistinguishable from normal mic audio for many utterances. This not only makes conversations sound normal (so you could wear a throat mic in a Zoom meeting at a noisy cafe and colleagues wouldn’t notice), but also greatly improves compatibility with speech-to-text systems. Standard ASR like Whisper will transcribe much more accurately if the audio sounds like typical speech. Essentially, the deep model acts as a front-end that converts “body-conducted” speech to “air-conducted” speech, making it a drop-in replacement for a normal mic in software.

In fact, improvements in recognition can approach those from training the ASR on throat data. For example, earlier we cited an enhancement yielding ~71% accuracy vs 88% for a retrained ASR . With modern deep learning conversion, we can expect that gap to close further, potentially allowing off-the-shelf recognizers like Whisper to achieve high accuracy on throat mic input (since the input is now effectively in-domain for them).

Computational cost: Here’s where trade-offs come in. These advanced models are computationally heavy compared to earlier methods. Autoregressive vocoders like WaveNet can produce fantastic quality but require performing thousands of neural computations per audio millisecond (though optimizations like WaveRNN/LPCNet dramatically reduce this). Newer parallel vocoders (GANs, etc.) are much faster but still involve convolutional networks running on frames of data. Running a HiFi-GAN or similar on a low-power CPU in real-time is challenging. However, there are optimized versions and smaller models. LPCNet is a noteworthy example: it combines neural networks with classical LPC to achieve high quality at low complexity, even demonstrated on a Cortex-M7 microcontroller in some cases. A model like LPCNet (which uses a lightweight neural network to generate 16 kHz speech) can run in real-time on a Cortex-A class CPU or even on an FPU-equipped microcontroller with careful tuning. That makes it a candidate for an embedded solution where a full GAN vocoder would be too much. Similarly, one could use a smaller TinyML model – e.g. a 1D convolutional model that operates on spectrogram patches – and deploy it on accelerators.

Hardware viability: For truly tiny devices (Cortex-M4 at a few MHz of processing budget), running a deep neural vocoder end-to-end is not feasible. You’d stick to the simpler DSP or at most a small shallow network. But for more capable embedded hardware, there are options:
	•	Cortex-A processors (smartphone, Pi, etc.): These can run medium-sized deep models on the CPU, especially leveraging NEON vectorization. For instance, a Raspberry Pi 4 (Cortex-A72) or a modern smartphone (Cortex-A78 cores, etc.) can run a Lite version of a vocoder or a moderate CNN in real-time. By using frameworks like TensorFlow Lite or ONNX Runtime with quantization, one could likely get, say, a 5 million-parameter model to run within ~50 ms per frame on CPU. The latency might be on the order of a few frames (say 20–40 ms frame and some processing buffer), which fits in the 100 ms budget. An iPhone or Android phone could potentially do even better by offloading to a Neural Processing Unit or DSP core that they have for audio. So, a throat-mic processing app on a phone (without using the cloud) is conceivable with careful model design.
	•	Google Edge TPU: The Edge TPU is an accelerator for quantized neural networks (8-bit) optimized for CNNs and dense layers. If one can quantize the enhancement model (which is likely, especially if it’s a convolutional encoder-decoder mapping spectrograms), the Edge TPU can perform 4 trillion ops/sec in a few watts – more than enough for a reasonably sized model. The challenge is that the model architecture must be supported (Edge TPU has some limitations, e.g. no large dynamic RNNs). A pure convolutional model or feed-forward model is supported. One approach is to have the Edge TPU handle the heavy lifting (like a spectrogram-to-spectrogram transformation via a deep CNN), and then a lightweight vocoder or ISTFT runs on the CPU. This hybrid can fit in a small box with USB power. The advantage is low power consumption relative to a CPU/GPU – ideal for battery devices. For example, an Edge TPU (as in Coral dev board or USB stick) typically uses around 1–2 W when busy, which could be battery-operated for hours. With Edge TPU, real-time processing is very achievable – inference can be done faster than realtime if the model is moderate, easily meeting <100 ms latency. The downside is development complexity (model quantization and Edge TPU compiler quirks) and somewhat inflexible model design.
	•	NVIDIA Jetson: Jetson modules (Nano, TX2, Xavier, Orin, etc.) are essentially small GPUs with ARM CPUs. They excel at running deep learning models and can definitely run neural vocoders or complex models in real-time. For instance, a Jetson Nano can run a WaveGlow or smaller HiFi-GAN at maybe 0.5x–1x real-time, and more powerful Jetsons can easily surpass real-time. Jetson’s strength is that you can use the same frameworks (PyTorch, etc.) with GPU acceleration. In a prototyping scenario, one could deploy a high-quality model on a Jetson and get great results. However, the power draw (5–10 W on Nano, up to 30 W on Xavier/Orin) means you’d need a sizable battery for prolonged use, and thermal management becomes a concern for wearable or pocket devices. Jetson would be more suitable for, say, a vehicular system or a stationary device (or if plugged in). That said, Jetson gives a lot of headroom: one could even run real-time speech recognition (Whisper) on the same device along with the conversion, if desired, or run more advanced models that wouldn’t fit on an Edge TPU.
	•	PC/Mac without GPU: Modern CPUs, especially on desktops or laptops, are quite powerful. A multi-core CPU can often handle real-time audio deep models if optimized. For example, the original WaveNet (which was slow) was later optimized to run on CPUs using vectorization – and similarly, models like RNNoise (an RNN for noise suppression) run in real-time on one CPU core. One could envision a CPU-only solution using, say, a combination of a small recurrent network for spectral mapping and an efficient vocoder. If the PC has an x86 CPU with AVX instructions, or an Apple M1/M2 with its neural engine (or even just its fast CPU cores), you can reach real-time with careful code. The latency on a PC can be very low (you could process on 5–10 ms frames with only a few ms overhead if the model is light), easily under the 100 ms mark. The user specifically noted possibly using a PC/Mac without a discrete GPU, so this is likely the scenario: you could have the throat mic feed audio into a software utility on the PC that does the conversion in real-time and presents a virtual audio device that applications (Zoom, etc.) use. This is technically feasible today; for instance, one might adapt an open-source speech enhancement model or even run the above-mentioned Mimi codec model on CPU. The 2025 study achieved real-time with Mimi – likely on a standard PC  – which proves the point.

Latency considerations: The user desires ideally <10 ms latency, but up to 100 ms is acceptable. Let’s be clear: analog and simple DSP can hit the sub-10 ms easily. Shallow ML models can also be under 10 ms processing time, though typically you might frame the audio in ~20 ms chunks (10 ms frame shift) for feature extraction, introducing about 20 ms inherent delay. Many real-time audio pipelines settle around 20–30 ms total latency which is usually transparent to users (that’s similar to a VoIP call). Hitting truly below 10 ms total might require very small frame sizes (e.g. 5 ms) and efficient processing – doable with simpler methods but tough with large models. Deep learning models often work on at least 20 ms frames or larger (some neural vocoders effectively work on 50 ms or more of audio at a time). For instance, the Mimi codec mentioned runs at 12.5 Hz frames (80 ms)   – so that system likely has ~80 ms algorithmic delay, plus maybe a bit of buffering. 80 ms is within the 100 ms limit and generally is fine for conversation (it’s a small fraction of a second). If stricter low latency is needed (e.g. for musical applications or truly instant feedback), one would need to trade off some quality or complexity to reduce frame size. There are streaming models (like streaming conv nets or RNNs) that can output incrementally with perhaps 5–10 ms lookahead – those are more specialized but possible.

In summary, deep learning approaches offer the best quality, nearly normalizing the throat mic audio to studio mic level, at the cost of higher computational demand. They are viable on more powerful embedded platforms (Cortex-A, Edge TPU, Jetson) and even on modern CPUs without GPUs, thanks to optimizations. For battery-powered portable use, one would lean toward either an optimized model on a mobile SoC (smartphone) or an accelerator like Edge TPU, to balance power and performance. For instance, a battery-powered throat mic unit might incorporate a Cortex-A7x processor or a Qualcomm AI DSP to run a moderate model in real-time. Another design could offload the processing to the user’s smartphone via Bluetooth (the throat mic sends raw audio to a phone app which does the enhancement). This keeps the throat device simple and low-power, leveraging the phone’s processor (which is still “battery-powered” but a larger battery).

Conclusion

To make a throat mic sound like a normal mic, multiple approaches can be combined. An analog front-end can do initial filtering, a DSP module can apply quick fixes (EQ, dynamic noise addition), and a learned model can do the heavy lifting of truly reconstructing speech details. For very constrained devices (Cortex-M4), one is mostly limited to analog/DSP methods and perhaps a tiny neural net – enough for a noticeable improvement but not perfection. On more capable edge devices (Cortex-A or with accelerators), modern machine learning and neural vocoders are viable in real-time, and they offer the most complete transformation, suitable for high-quality voice communication and accurate speech-to-text with Whisper or others. Recent research and demos confirm that real-time throat mic enhancement is achievable with deep models , so it’s an exciting time – the once “muffled” throat mic can now be augmented to sound almost like you’re talking into a regular microphone, even as it silences the noisy world around you.
